                    <p>I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia until moving to San Francisco 3 years ago. I previously worked for a coding bootcamp and saw the positive impact it had on individual’s lives so I decided to take the leap. With my finance and math background, data science fit right into my interests. Besides work, I’m a lover of the ocean! I fill up most of my time surfing, swimming, and diving.</p>

                    <p>Joel was born in Boulder, CO. He started in tech at 19. In the 15 years since he climbed the ladder from Helpdesk support to running enterprise server architecture at a fortune500. On request from his wife in January 2018 I quit my job, sold everything and traveled the world with only a backpack. While on the road I decided to switch careers and build software that powers the world. In my spare time I'm a competitive golfer and avid outdoors enthusiast.</p>
